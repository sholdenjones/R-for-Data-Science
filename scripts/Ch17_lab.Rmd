need programing for all data science work!

code as vehicle for communication - to computer and other humans
want code to be easy to write and easy to read

pipes - when to use, when not to, and alternatives

functions - extract out repeated code that can be easily reused
          - copy-and-paste is powerful, but avoid doing it more than twice
          
vectors - solid grounding in R's data structures, necessary for writing more
        - powerful functions
        
iteration - tools that let you do similar things again and again
