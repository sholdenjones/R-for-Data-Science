# 14.2 String basics

can create strings with "" or '', usually do "" unless need multiple quotes
```{r}
string1 <- "This is a string"
string2 <- 'If I want to include a "quote" inside a string, I use single quotes'

have to be really specific with quotes within strings, and backslashes

use writeLines() to see the actual string contents

"\n" for newline and "\n" for tab
