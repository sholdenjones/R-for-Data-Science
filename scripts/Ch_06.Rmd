devtools::install_github("mine-cetinkaya-rundel/addmins", type = "source")
library(addmins)

# then use via addins GUI above to help with formatting

# Example ----------------------------------------------------------------------
library(dplyr)
# code and comments

# Example 2 --------------------------------------------------------------------
```
